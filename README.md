# Drive Ya' Nuts

Drive Ya' Nuts is a board game from the 70s  (info [here](https://www.geekyhobbies.com/drive-ya-nuts-puzzle-review-and-solution/)). 

Instead of smartly solving this board game like someone did [here](https://www.wittenberg.edu/sites/default/files/media/computer_science/forms/sumInSMC.pdf) - let's shuffle the position and rotation of the pieces on the board randomly, until we get a solution. Maybe you'll get it the second try, or the 1 billionth. Go nuts!
